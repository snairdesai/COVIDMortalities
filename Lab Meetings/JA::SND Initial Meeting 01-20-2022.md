- Started working on this in the context on two projects → work began roughly 6 week ago → most of the team is overcommitted with other duties (Weining is at the IMF; Yothin is at the ADB; Rashad is at Treasury; Aizenman is at USC)
  
- Team: Yothin Jinjarak, Weining Xin, Rashad Ahmed (but currently overcommitted), also an Israeli professor who joined the team, and they finished one paper together
  

- The Israeli professor graduated from MIT and is affiliated with the CEPR

- PROJECT PUZZLE: We want to take stock of Covid-19 after two years, and make a global comparisons between countries → we want to look at a measure dealing with mortality per capita after two years of the pandemic
  
- Then we want to make quartile comparisons of cumulative deaths by the end of 2021 across countries
  

- When they looked at the quartiles according to the official data are very different from the quartiles according to excess mortality

- In the official data, countries with higher GDP per capita, greater health expenditures systematically are performing substantially worse
  
- In the excess mortality data, the relationship essentially flips → so countries with lower GDP per capita, resources, etc. are performing substantially worse
  

- They tried to explain this with several possibilities: 1) the arrival of vaccinations may have improved the performance of wealthier countries (which have improved their relative rankings over time); 2) countries that are characterized by weaker rules and accountability are performing better in actual mortality because of weaker data infrastructure, etc.
  
- The regression results are consistent with both interpretations → the problem is Weining and Yothin are both overcommitted and cannot run additional regressions → would love for you to join and push towards a working paper
  

- Seems like you would be working to correct multicollinearity, run the robustness checks, etc.
  
- The underlying econometrics here is pretty simple → they are not running any complex panel study, it’s an aggregation and interpolation of a cross-sectional analysis
  

- Horarium is possible, but this is unlikely because you are not longer unaffiliated with USC (roughly will be $3K disbursement)
  
- You may be hired as a contractor through Aizenman
  

- The main issue will be framing this in a way which is politically palatable giving Rashad’s and Weining’s role (at IMF and Treasury)

- Two ways to think about this: 1) focus on the official data on mortality; 2) examine excess mortality → They ended up doing both of these things
  
- Wanted to make a simple cross-section of mortalities across countries and characterize the factors (policies, structural, demographics) which explains the relative ranking of Covid deaths across countries
  
- They decided to focus on the first two years of the pandemic at this stage → they may add a later contrast which compares the first year vs. the second year
  

NEXT STEPS: Aizenman will email the fragments of what we have now → we can move from there with code and analysis (he expects this to end up in Economic Modeling or the like)

MEETINGS ARE WEEKLY EVERY SUNDAY AT 11AM EAST COAST TIME.
