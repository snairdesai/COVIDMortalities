- Started working on this in the context on two projects → work began roughly 6 week ago → however, most of the team is overcommitted with other duties (Weining is at the IMF; Yothin is at the ADB; Rashad is at Treasury; Aizenman is at USC).
  
- Team: Yothin Jinjarak, Weining Xin, Rashad Ahmed (but currently overcommitted), also an Israeli professor who joined the team. This team already finished one paper together previously.
  
    - The Israeli professor graduated from MIT and is affiliated with the CEPR.

- **RESEARCH PUZZLE: We want to take stock of Covid-19 after two years, and make a global comparisons between countries → in other words, we want to look at a measure dealing with mortality per capita after two years of the pandemic.**
  
- **ANALYSIS:** The goal is to analyze a simple cross-section of mortalities across countries, and characterize deaths by common factors (policies, structural, demographics) which can explain the relative ranking of Covid deaths across countries across the first two years (2020 - 2022) of the pandemic.

    - *Note:* They decided to focus on the first two years of the pandemic at this stage, but they may add a later contrast which compares the first year vs. the second year depending on the results.

- **DATA:** There are two ways to think about the mortality data which would enable us to answer this: 1) focus on the official data on mortality; 2) examine excess mortality → They ended up doing both of these things.
  
   - Using these separate datasets, they constructed quartiles of countries by their cumulative deaths as of the end of 2021.

   - However, when they looked at the quartiles according to the official data, they found these were very different from the quartiles according to excess mortality measures.

      - In the *official data*, countries with higher GDP per capita, greater health expenditures systematically are performing substantially worse.
  
      - In the *excess mortality data*, the relationship essentially flips → so countries with lower GDP per capita, resources, etc. are performing substantially worse.

- They tried to explain this with several possibilities, but **two explanations rose to the top**: 
    - **1)** The arrival of vaccinations may have improved the performance of wealthier countries (which have improved their relative rankings over time). 
    - **2)** Countries that are characterized by weaker rules and accountability are performing better in actual mortality because of weaker data infrastructure, etc.
  
- The regression results are consistent with *both interpretations* → Yothin and Weining are running regressions for **1)** and **2)** respectively, and *both have found significant effects*. There is also evidence of multicollinearity in both models. 

    - Currently, Weining and Yothin are both overcommitted and cannot run additional regressions → **this will be your role**. So, you will be running additional models, working to correct multicollinearity, running robustness checks, etc.

    - *Note*: The underlying econometrics here are pretty simple → they are not running any complex panel study, it’s an aggregation and interpolation of a cross-sectional analysis. You should be able to handle this with your current knowledge.
    
    - Another core issue (which will arise during drafting) will be framing this in a way which is politically palatable giving Rashad’s and Weining’s role (at IMF and Treasury).

    - In terms of publication, Aizenman expects this to end up in Economic Modeling or the like (perhaps a European Journal). We will first aim for an NBER WP.
  
- **LOGISTICS:** An horarium is possible, but this could be unlikely because you are not longer unaffiliated with USC (if it does come through, it will roughly translate to a $3K disbursement). To make this work, you may be hired by Aizenman as an independent contractor.
  

**NEXT STEPS: Aizenman will email the fragments of what we have now → we can move from there with code and analysis.**
